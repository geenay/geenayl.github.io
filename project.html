    <h2 class="heading">problem</h2>
    <p class="explain">The problem was simply that there was no concept to work from or any brand to reference to.
      This project was built from the ground up and had very strong competitors.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">solution</h2>
    <p class="explain">This is Myriad. The solution was to create a WebApp that combined cloud storage and project management. It’s a simplistic design and a beautiful brand that appeals to both the creative and the corporate world.
      It offers the opportunity to upload content, create projects, add team members, collaborate with team members as well as be able to contact them directly.
      You can categorise your content by folders and organise everything into specific projects.</p>

      <h2 class="process">Understanding user's expectations and frustrations</h2>
      <p class="process">I needed to better understand the perspective user. To do this, I talked to local creatives, project managers and agencies.
        I also created online surveys that I sent out to get a broader persepective.<br>
        78.3% of people used Cloud Storage platforms<br>
        83.3% of people use it for both personal and professional use<br>
        43.5% of people were in between the ages of 25-35 years old</p>

    <p class="explain">To do this, I set up a competitive analysis SWOT Analysis of Pinterest, Dropbox and Google drive comparing catorising and navigating content, effectiveness of UI, download and sharing abilities.<br>
      An important feature is to be able to collaborate; something the client wanted to focus on.</p>

      <p class="explain">I translated User Stories into seemless User Flows. User Flows give you an idea of the crucial features and pages needed in Myriad to solve the outlined problem.<br>
        So many things had to be considered ie. how content would be accessible, how collaboration would work and how project management can come into play.</p>

      <p class="explain">I made sure I follow the user  flow above and keeping a logical site hierarchy. I also started to think of how the user would access projects quickly, how they would navigate to specific content and people.<br>
        Although we are not doing mobile site in this phase, I aimed for responsiveness in my design and envisioned how elements on the page can be re-stacked fluidly.</p>

      <section>
        <p>This version had a lot of promise but it didn’t look as professional as a HiFi Mock-Up.  I counted on User Research, Testing and feedback to answer a lot of the questions I had on usability and design.</p>

        <p>I made inspiration board for the mood and tone for Myriad brand and website. I decided on having fun colours that give the brand a personality.
          I wanted to create a strong brand that can turn into a community that people want to be a part of.  </p>

        <h2 class="heading">final take aways</h2>
        <p>Designing Myriad was a big learning curve for me! The first challenge came only once my initial Wireframes were transformed into Hi-Fi’s and I received feedback on it from users.
          I realised that there was too much line work and that everything seemed boxed in. The chatroom functionality was taking up so much space on the screen. This isn’t ideal as the WebApp should be all about content.
          I went through a very big design and structure change but kept all the same features. On Round 2 of feedback analysis I decided to scale back on features that weren’t necessary.
          This also dialed down the amount of buttons I had on the screen. My last round of testing and feedback just helped me change small things like making the payment process easier as well as ensuring consistency etc.
          Although my project did evolve a lot throughout this process, I learned so much about quality design and minimising rather than maximising the amount of features a user needs.
          I learned to listen to the user rather than what my ideal webapp would be.  <br>
          Key take-away <br>Your initial design will very rarely look like the final product</p>
